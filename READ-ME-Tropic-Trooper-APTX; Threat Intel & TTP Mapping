Visual mapping using MITRE ATT&CK

1. Project Overview

This project documents a cyber threat intelligence investigation conducted in a simulated SOC environment. The focus was on analyzing the TTPs of Tropic Trooper (APT X) and mapping their techniques using industry-standard frameworks and platforms.

2. Task Breakdown

✏️ Task 1: Identifying the Threat Actor

⭕️ Objective:
Identify the threat actor responsible for the USBferry malware campaign and understand their primary TTPs.

⭕️ Method:

Reviewed a threat advisory report linked in the TryHackMe Trooper room.

Searched for "Tropic Trooper" in OpenCTI.

Investigated their tactics: spear-phishing, lateral movement, and USB-based attacks.

✅ Outcome:

Identified Tropic Trooper (APT X), known for targeting government and military institutions.

Collected screenshots showing Tropic Trooper’s profile and TTPs from OpenCTI.

✏️ Task 2: Investigating USBferry Malware

⭕️ Objective:
Analyze the USBferry malware and extract its related TTPs.

⭕️ Method:

Searched for “USBferry” in OpenCTI.

Reviewed malware details, attack patterns, and indicators of compromise.

Explored relationships tab for related techniques.

✅ Outcome:
Identified several MITRE ATT&CK techniques:

T1091 – Replication Through Removable Media

T1119 – Automated Collection

T1082 – System Information Discovery

T1120 – Peripheral Device Discovery

✏️ Task 3: Mapping to MITRE ATT&CK

⭕️ Objective:
Correlate identified techniques to MITRE ATT&CK and visualize them in Navigator.

⭕️ Method:

Created a custom MITRE Navigator layer.

Mapped USBferry-related techniques.

Annotated each technique with observations.

✅ Outcome:
Mapped techniques:

T1082 – System Information Discovery

T1120 – Peripheral Device Discovery

T1091 – Replication Through Removable Media

3. Analysis and Reflection

💡 Challenges Faced:

Understanding how infected USBs reached air-gapped targets raised questions about victim behavior and security controls, prompting broader thinking about threat modeling.

💡 Lessons Learned:

TTPs must be understood in operational context.

Platforms like OpenCTI and MITRE ATT&CK structure investigation.

Mapping intel supports practical security strategy.

💡 Relevance to SOC Analyst Role:

Helps prioritize alerts and triage events.

Connects indicators to real-world behaviors.

Aids in building and refining detection rules.

💡 Relevance to Penetration Testing:

Informs realistic test scenarios.

Emphasizes physical and behavioral attack vectors.

Enhances red team exercises through TTP simulation.

4. Conclusion

💡 Summary:

Identified Tropic Trooper as the actor behind USBferry.

Mapped malware behavior to MITRE techniques.

Learned key CTI and analytical skills applicable in SOC operations.

💡 Skills Gained:

Threat intelligence analysis

Framework-based technique mapping

Report structuring and documentation

💡 Next Steps:

Use findings to guide SOC playbook development.

Incorporate these TTPs into simulated adversary emulation plans.
